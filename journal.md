# The New Cell Phone Law
My thoughts on the cell phone ban are really negative, but mixed as well. It sounds like a good idea on paper, but the way it was executed was really bad. The fact that not a single person on campus can use it, not even the teachers sometimes, is ridiculous to me. I saw someone point this out as well, what if there's a lockdown and nobody can use their phone to call the police or their parents? I mean, most likely you can use it for times like that, but their point still stands.
# Vibe Coding with AI
There are be a lot risks with using AI for code. I feel like the main one is that you can just type in a prompt and get your answer without even learning the actual thing. AI can be used for good, obviously, but a large majority of its use is for bad. Plus, classes (such as yours) are starting to use AI detection, so it's a lot harder to use it.
# Computer Science Expectations
I thought computer science was going to be just using computers, maybe learn a thing or two from it, but I thought it would be a "free" class. Turns out, I was very wrong. I'm not good at coding, I'll be honest, I tried to "code" in some games (mainly one called Geometry Dash) before, but I ultimately gave up with how confusing it was. Hopefully this year I can learn more about game design because I have an idea for a game I think would be pretty successful.

# Ikea on Roblox
I've heard about this situation when it first got announced last year, but I didn't really have a real opinion on it. Now that it's a part of my grade, I have to come up with an opinion. I'll just get it out of the way, I'm pretty mixed on it. I think it's a good idea having something feel like the actual real life experience, since it can get people to wonder if they should get the actual job. Especially since they're getting paid real money, it could be good. But real money being paid is just making me think of a problem. There's an exploit/application that basically makes the game play itself, and obviously, people can abuse this. This could mean people can earn so much money from doing it without actually doing it. I think there's some sort of detection to see if people are actually playing, but I'm not sure. Again, pretty mixed on it, it's a good and bad idea.

# The "6 7" phrase
I... don't know. There's a lot of origins, but the real one isn't clear. One of them is a kid screaming "Aye, six seven!" at a school basketball game, which is mainly why kids are screaming it. Another is from a song where he says he's 6'7. There's also one from another song, saying they're from "67th street". There's many more, but these are the main ones.
