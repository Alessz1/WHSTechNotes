The robot can be activated with the light of the phone, by a sensor it has.

# The New Cell Phone Law
My thoughts on the cell phone ban are really negative, but mixed as well. It sounds like a good idea on paper, but the way it was executed was really bad. The fact that not a single person on campus can use it, not even the teachers sometimes, is ridiculous to me. I saw someone point this out as well, what if there's a lockdown and nobody can use their phone to call the police or their parents? I mean, most likely you can use it for times like that, but their point still stands.
# Vibe Coding with AI
There are be a lot risks with using AI for code. I feel like the main one is that you can just type in a prompt and get your answer without even learning the actual thing. AI can be used for good, obviously, but a large majority of its use is for bad. Plus, classes (such as yours) are starting to use AI detection, so it's a lot harder to use it.
# Computer Science Expectations
I thought computer science was going to be just using computers, maybe learn a thing or two from it, but I thought it would be a "free" class. Turns out, I was very wrong. I'm not good at coding, I'll be honest, I tried to "code" in some games (mainly one called Geometry Dash) before, but I ultimately gave up with how confusing it was. Hopefully this year I can learn more about game design because I have an idea for a game I think would be pretty successful.
